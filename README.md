## Challenges & Observations

- **States & the concept of `reactivity`**: something.

**Stores in `SvelteJs`**: The whole concept of external stores felt different in Svelte. The first question I had was _why attach `$:` to store values and why some blog contents were omitted_.

- **Passing functions as props**: Passing props in svelte components is required using the `export` keyword. I always had to declare arrow functions using the `let` keyword. Although I intentionally 🧐 avoided using the `dispatch` in Svelte.

- **Stores & Context in SvelteJS**: store
